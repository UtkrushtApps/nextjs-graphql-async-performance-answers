# Solution Steps

1. Define strictly typed GraphQL schema and TypeScript type mappings for AssessmentResult data.

2. Create a type-safe GraphQL client using graphql-request and modularize GraphQL queries and mutations as files.

3. Implement server-side (getServerSideProps) data fetching to SSR the initial result with error handling.

4. Build the Assessment Result page to show live result data: use SWR to poll and revalidate, display graceful loading and error fallback states, and modularize heavy content (FeedbackChart) using Next.js dynamic imports and React Suspense.

5. Develop FeedbackChart as a heavy, dynamically loaded component for insights and feedback visualization.

6. Implement an API route (pages/api/result-webhook.ts) to simulate a webhook notifying the system about a new/updated result. Trigger background jobs (email notification, analytics logging) using setImmediate so they run after response, never blocking the API call.

7. Simulate concurrency/race protection in mock database updates using per-key in-memory mutexes in server/db.ts to avoid data races when multiple webhooks try to update simultaneously.

8. Add simple mock background jobs (sendResultEmail and logAnalyticsEvent) for notification and analytics, ensuring they're async and non-blocking.

9. Provide a minimalist GraphQL server endpoint (pages/api/graphql.ts) to back the client fetches.

10. Modularize all logic, ensuring clear type boundaries between GraphQL types, API, client/data layer, and server jobs.

11. Test performance/optimization by ensuring UI renders rapidly (SSR & fallback), async errors are handled, and background jobs do not block user experience.
